# CXPatcher
A patcher to upgrade Crossover dependencies and improve compatibility

This is an **unofficial patcher** for Crossover and codeweavers is not - by any means - involved in this or has anything to do with this app, and although has been tested, this software may render the app unusable or unstable, **USE AT YOUR OWN RISK**, this also will void any official support from Codeweavers, If you still need support from codeweavers, download the original unmodified app and please don't report problems to them after your app is patched.

if you have any issues after your app has been patched you can download a new copy of Crossover.

# What does it do?
This patcher will upgrade your crossover app with the latest dxvk and moltenvk patched for improved compatibility, and fix the current issue with the latest Ventura update

# Instructions
You need to have an unmodified version of Crossover, you can download it at: https://www.codeweavers.com/account/downloads, please make sure the app has been registered or ran at least once, to make sure the latest dxvk is activated properly You may need to switch off dxvk and on again, if you don't you will need to re-download it. If the patcher renders the app unusable you can either use the restore function (see instructions below) or download it again from the website, it doesn't do any permanent modifications to your 'bottles'.

## Restoring a patched app to the original app
Maybe you changed your mind and prefer to use your original crossover app.
You can restore by going to the `file -> restore menu`

## Patching other versions of crossover
By default this app doesn't patch Crossver versions other than 22.1.1, but if you need you can force patching the other versions using the toggle "Patch any crossover version", then you can just drag an drop.

## Color profiles for UE4 games:
You can change the way the colors are processed in ue4 games.

**examples:**

**disable color profiles** 

(old greyish colors but may improve performance or fix dark or oversaturated colors)

`NAS_TONEMAP_C=0`

**Color profile for Stray**

`NAS_TONEMAP_C=clamp({inputColor} * float3x3( 0.2126 + 0.7874 * 1.5, 0.7152 - 0.7152 * 1.5, 0.0722 - 0.0722 * 1.5, 0.2126 - 0.2126 * 1.5, 0.7152 + 0.2848 * 1.5, 0.0722 - 0.0722 * 1.5, 0.2126 - 0.2126 * 1.5, 0.7152 - 0.7152 * 1.5, 0.0722 + 0.9278 * 1.5 ) * 2 - float3(0.28, 0.2, 0.16), 0.0, 1.0)`

`NAS_TONEMAP_C` uses standard MSL shading language, as long as it's done in one line, you can use {inputColor} as a variable and modify the colors, or give any effect you like using matrix transforms, have fun!

**Note:** `NAS_TONEMAP_C` only works for UE4 games
